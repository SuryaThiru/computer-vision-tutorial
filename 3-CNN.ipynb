    "\n",
    "CNNs are biologically-inspired models inspired by research by D. H. Hubel and T. N. Wiesel. They proposed an explanation for the way in which mammals visually perceive the world around them using a layered architecture of neurons in the brain, and this in turn inspired engineers to attempt to develop similar pattern recognition mechanisms in computer vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "In their hypothesis, within the visual cortex, complex functional responses generated by \"complex cells\" are constructed from more simplistic responses from \"simple cells'.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instances, simple cells would respond to oriented edges etc, while complex cells will also respond to oriented edges but with a degree of spatial invariance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Receptive fields exist for cells, where a cell responds to a summation of inputs from other local cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture of deep convolutional neural networks was inspired by the ideas mentioned above\n",
    "\n",
    "- local connections\n",
    "- layering\n",
    "- spatial invariance (shifting the input signal results in an equally shifted output signal. , most of us are able to recognize specific faces under a variety of conditions because we learn abstraction These abstractions are thus invariant to size, contrast, rotation, orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it remains to be seen if these computational mechanisms of convolutional neural networks are similar to the computation mechanisms occurring in the primate visual system\n",

    "- However, with coloured images, particularly RGB (Red, Green, Blue)-based images, the presence of separate colour channels (3 in the case of RGB images) introduces an additional ‘depth’ field to the data, making the input 3-dimensional. \n",
    "- Hence, for a given RGB image of size, say 255×255 (Width x Height) pixels, we’ll have 3 matrices associated with each image, one for each of the colour channels. \n",
