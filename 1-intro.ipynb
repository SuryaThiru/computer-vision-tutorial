    "In research and development (R&D), interactive computing environments are a frequently employed alternative for data exploration, algorithm development and prototyping. In the last twelve years, a popular scientific computing environment flourished around the Python programming language. Most of this environment is part of (or built over) a software stack named the SciPy Stack. Combined to the OpenCVâ€™s Python interface, this environment becomes an alternative for current computer vision R&D. This tutorial introduces such an environment and shows how it can address different steps on computer vision "

    "In the last twelve years, a powerful scientific computing environment emerged from the Python programming community. This language is an attractive option for researchers: it is interpreted (a wanted property for interactive computing environments), dynamically typed, and presents a very concise and elegant syntax, resembling the pseudo-code found in computer science textbooks. But the tipping point for Python to become a major player in scientific computing was the advent of an efficient module for  nn -dimensional array representation and manipulation. The Numarray module was created by Greenfield et al. to address astronomical data analysis. In 2005, Numarray successor, NumPy, appeared and became the workhorse of the Python scientific computing. \n",

The statistical relation between the world state and the observed images is defined by models. A particular model is defined by parameters, chosen by learning algorithms.
